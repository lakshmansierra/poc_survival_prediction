## Censoring
- `Censoring` means we don’t observe the proper end event. Why?
- (a) They're still ruling in 2008 → `right-censored`.
- (b) They died while in office → `right-censored` because they didn’t voluntarily retire.

```bash
Retirement = event
Died/still in office = censored
```
- This shows that `event` and `censoring` can mean different things, depending on what you're modeling.
